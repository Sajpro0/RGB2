this file contains globally defined ids of the datastore

format: [e]id (modifier): description
example:	69 (perm:string): the funny register containing a string "sex"
			e420 (perm:string): register in the extended datastore containing a string "funny weed number"
			13 (rw:byte[4]): a static ip address to use

all of the above are just examples and are not actually used
----------

1 (perm:string): permanent device ID, this is NOT the device NAME, it is a unique string the device has of a potentially known format
2 (rw:string): readable device string name
3 (perm:string): csv of the device's features
4 (perm:bytes): byte array of datastore entries on the device, format:
	1 byte register id + 1 byte other register id + ... + 1 byte EXTENDED REGISTER byte + 
	2 byte extended register id + 2 byte other extended register id + ... + (packet ends)
	it is UNDEFINED if this register is included in the list
32 (rw:string): wifi login SSID prefided with a "1" character if it is rw and "0" if the value is not changeable
33 (rw:string): wifi login password with same format as id 32
128 (rpc:byte[4]): get or set current rgbv values, the bytes go as RGBV, indicating the current percentage (0-255) of the color or volume,
	this and it's subversions might not be implemented on a device while the device might still accept rgbv commands
129 (rpc:bytes[8]): 128 but 16bit precision, does NOT directly translate to percentage, min is 0 and max is determined by register 130
130 (rpc:bytes[8]): 129 but carries the maximum values for each property
