every rgb device can support the datastore protocols
datastore works by using globally standardized 8bit ids as keys

datastore values can be:
	permanent: the value is permanently set, used just so the controller can retreive information from it (like fw version)
		some devices can support changing this value, but it will only be a temporary overlay of the permanent data with the value
	rw: the value is saved on the device in a non-volatile storage, persisting across power cycles and restarts
		this is used for storing configuration data like wifi login credentials
	temporary: the value is unset at start and can be loaded by the controller

there are 2 data stores:
	regular (8bit): id=0 is illegal, id=254 means extended datastore in protocol talk, id=255 is reserved for now
		used to save all sorts of common universal values that most devices usually have in common
	extended (16bit): id=0 is illegal, id=1-253 are permanent values for the same ids used in the regular datastore
		used to save more specific configurations (like currently active filters or other kinds of toggles)


data type and if it is perm/rw/temp is statically globally defined
when a device does not recognize the id, it must reject it
because of ids being statically linked to types, each must also have a defined default value (though the definition can be "undefined")
