every rgb device can support the datastore protocols
datastore works by using globally standardized 8bit ids as keys

datastore values can be:
	permanent: the value is permanently set, used just so the controller can retreive information from it (like fw version)
	rw: the value is saved on the device in a non-volatile storage, persisting across power cycles and restarts
		this is used for storing configuration data like wifi login credentials
		the value is temporary and is only saved when receiving a save command unless specified otherwise (some kind of autosave system)
	temporary: the value is defined at start according to it's documentation
		the value can be set and get by the controller as well as the device itself unless specified otherwise
		cannot be used for rpc, unlike rpc, which can be implemented as regular temp storage
	rpc: the value is generated and sent back on read or processed on write

permanent storage resides in the microcontroller's data memory (defined as const in the program) so everything points to that location
rw storage resides in whatever storage the microcontroller decides to use and is loaded ONCE on startup and then can be subsequently loaded and saved by commands
temporary storage is loaded at start and changeable at runtime, it has a static default value specified in it's docs unless specified otherwise

there are 2 data stores:
	regular (8bit): id=0 is illegal, id=254 means extended datastore in protocol talk, id=255 is reserved for now
		used to save all sorts of common universal values that most devices usually have in common
	extended (16bit): id=0 is illegal, id=1-253 are permanent values for the same ids used in the regular datastore
		used to save more specific configurations (like currently active filters or other kinds of toggles)


data type and if it is perm/rw/temp is statically globally defined
when a device does not recognize the id, it must reject it
because of ids being statically linked to types, each must also have a defined default value (though the definition can be "undefined")
