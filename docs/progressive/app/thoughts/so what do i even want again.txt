here lies what comes up to my mind that i actually wanna use the thing for so i can hopefully use that to design a ui system that has the least problems
caused by not being universal enough

scenarios:
	i want to just set the rgb to some value:
		i can have an application specific for this
		as i wanna do the whole process thing, applications would just
		have a Load hook type of thing that can also add windows it
		can draw to
		the window can just have it's own sliders for the rgb values
		and a button to send them
		program simply works, it can use an rgb group to select devices
		and it can send commands to it
		done by:
			an output-only code block that outputs an impulse output
			(triggered by the button)
