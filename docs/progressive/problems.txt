here are the problems found or thought of and their fixes or improvement ideas

problem: multiple masters fighting over a device
	Idea:
		a way to get informed about this - be able to tell the time passed since last packet was received for each connection
		this way is also good because devices with multiple connectable clients as they already store this and use it to prioritize reusing connections
		main idea is to propably add another packet that behaves like the ping packet but with extra data and ignores the A bit and is ignored in creating connections

problem: optimizing using broadcast without sending data to each client
	Idea: open other udp ports for this
		put clients into groups so we can still use broadcast but with a different port
